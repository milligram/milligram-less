## Building

First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for the build process. Now install all the dependencies, run `npm install` from the project directory. Once you have the dependencies installed, run `npm start`.


## Style Guide

In this version, Milligram use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) to give super powers to CSS. Look at how the code is being maintained, we must always be consistent. We try to follow best practices as much as possible. In addition, here are some tips you should follow:

- Properties and selectors are sorted in alphabetical order
- Always use tab to indentation, no spaces
- Always use single quote, i.e. `content: ''`
- Quote attribute values in selectors, i.e. `input[type='checkbox']`
- Avoid specifying units for zero-values, i.e. `margin: 0`
- Use `rem` unit instead of `px`
- Use lowercase and shorthand hex values, i.e. `#fff`
- Use one discrete selector per line in multi-selector rulesets
- Include a single space after colon and after each comma
- Separate each ruleset by a blank line
- Don't use prefixes, there is a task to generate this automatically

```less
.selector-a,
.selector-b,
.selector-c,
.selector-d[type='text'] {
	box-sizing: border-box;
	color: #333;
	content: '';
	display: inline-block;
	font-family: 'Helvetica-Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif;
	margin-bottom: 0;
	margin-left: 5.0rem;

	.other-selector-a {
		background: #fff;

		.other-selector-b {
			background: #fff;
		}

		&.increasing-the-specificity {
			color: #000;
		}
	}
}
```

*Note: This style guide was inspired by [Idiomatic.css](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css). Milligram uses an `.editorconfig` file, which most editors support, to enforce these coding standards.*
